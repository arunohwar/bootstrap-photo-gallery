++Additions
1. Typo : Added https to src for script for jquery.min.js file.

2. Added the keyboard left and right buttons click functionality based on the suggestion (see michael's reply in comments) on http://michaelsoriano.com/next-and-previous-buttons-bootstrap-photo-gallery/

3. Adding support to show responsive-larger!! images on all viewports. Made the code more responsive by adding % values instead of pixels for bootstrap modal dialog.
